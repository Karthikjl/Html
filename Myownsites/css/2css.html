        What is Unity? Wikipedia defines it
        so: Unity is a cross-platform game engine 
        with a built-in IDE developed by Unity Technologies. 
        It is used to develop video games for web plugins, 
        desktop platforms, consoles and mobile devices.

    <h1>GitHub</h1>
    <p>
        GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, 
        the open source version control software that lets 
        multiple people make separate changes to web pages at 
        the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for 
        real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams 
        to work together to build and edit their site content.

    <h1>Clash of clans</h1>
    <p>
        The Clash of the Clans gaming app is safe for 
        kids with some adult supervision. The app is 
        rated for users 10+ but the terms of use require 
        users to be 13 years or older. The clan that a player 
        chooses will 
        dictate how safe their Clash of Clans game play is.
